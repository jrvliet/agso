Welcome to Las Cruces. Curious about balancing grad school and having a life? Somehow, we manage, and here are some examples of what we do for fun.
Las Cruces is at the Southern end of New Mexico and, as the second largest city in the state, has one of everything (but only one). For general information about Las Cruces check out the <a href="http://www.lascrucescvb.org/">Visitors Bureau website</a> (which includes general facts and figures about the region) and a calendar of events. Adjacent to Las Cruces is the charming historic town of <a href="http://www.oldmesilla.org/">Mesilla</a>. <br clear="all" />

<a name="food"></a><h3>Food &amp; Drink</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>So, where do people hang out for a drink? For a comprehensive guide check out <a href="http://astro.nmsu.edu/~jojohnso/guide.html">Tom and Joni's drinking guide to Las Cruces</a>. Different people have differing opinions about quality and selection of beer, but people have gone to the micro-bewery High Desert and the sports bar The Game. For beer and a good time, we have  two bars with dance floors (Hurricane Alley and El Patio), a larger bar and dance club (Graham's Central Station), as well as pool (My Brother's Place) and bowling (10 Pin Alley). Students have also been known to compete in <a href="http://www.geekswhodrink.com/150/">Trivia Night at Dublin's</a>.</p>
<p>
Speaking of spirits, New Mexico started producing wines in 1629, and some have even won top awards competing agains Californian wines. There are two wine festivals during the summer at the State Fairgrounds: the <a href="http://www.snmwinefestival.com/">Southern New Mexico Wine Festival</a> in May and the <a href="http://www.nmwine.com/">New Mexico Wine Harvest Festival</a> in September. You can sample wine from the many New Mexico wineries as well as enjoy live entertainment, local arts and crafts vendors, and the grape stomping contest (which one grad student won). </p>
In terms of restaurants there is more variety. There is Japanese at The Mix and Aqua Reef, Italian at SI and Olive Garden, American at Chili's, and a variety of Southwestern spicy (Mexican, New Mexican, and Tex Mex). Again, a good comprehensive guide is <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/~jojohnso/restaurant.html">Joni's Las Cruces restaurant guide</a>. There are also a few specialty grocery stores including organic food at Toucan's and the Mountain View co-op.
</div>
<a name="events"></a><h3>On the Town</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
What's going on in town? On the first Friday of each month Las Cruces has the Downtown Ramble, when shops and galleries on the Downtown Mall (Main Street) open their doors and offer free food and entertainment. For more music, try the <a href="http://www.las-cruces.org/en/News%20Articles/Free%20Music%20In%20The%20Park%20Series%20to%20Begin%20This%20Weekend.aspx">Music in the Park</a> series, where from July to September there is live music at one of the city parks. If dancing at the clubs isn't your fancy, there is Ballroom, Swing, and Latin dancing at the Country Club each week.<br />
<br />
Interested in local arts, crafts, and food? Every Saturday (summer and winter!) vendors flock to the <a href="http://lascrucesfarmersmarket.org/">Farmer's Market</a> on the mall in downtown Las Cruces. Mesilla hosts a smaller craft fair, the Mesilla Mercado, Fridays (11 am - 4 pm) and Sundays ( noon - 4 pm). Mountain View also hosts a local produce farmer's market every Sunday.<br />
<br />
Tired of main-stream blockbuster blowout movies? Mesilla also hosts the <a href="http://mesillavalleyfilm.org/">Fountain Theater</a>, one of the few places in the region to view independent and foreign films. </div>
<a name="websites"></a><h3>Online</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
Like grad students everywhere, we use a variety of online resources to keep ourselves entertained:
<ul>
<a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/">Astronomy Picture of the Day</a> (APOD)<br />
<a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD: Piled Higher and Deeper</a> webcomic for all the grad students (eg, <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=940">940</a> and <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=941">941</a>)<br />

<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/MathematicalHumor.html">Mathematical Humor</a> bad jokes and good laughs from Wolfram MathWorld</ul>
</div>
<a name="outdoors"></a><h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
Las Cruces enjoys 350 days of sunshine a year. There is plenty to do outdoors and students take advantage of that! The <a href="http://recsport.nmsu.edu/ac/">athletic center</a> on campus provides a lot: for example courts for tennis, handball, and racquetball; a climbing wall; two pools; and free camping/climbing equipment rental. They also offer <a href="http://www.aggiefit.org/activities_calendar.php">free courses</a> to all students, such as yoga, pilates, kickboxing, and zumba. We participate in group activities, too. Our department recently created an <a href="http://recsport.nmsu.edu/intramurals/">intramural softball team</a>, the Tombaugh Sluggers, as well as playing Ultimate Frisbee on the weekends. Speaking of courses, take advantage of the student discounted rates at the <a href="http://www.nmsugolf.com/golf/proto/nmsugolf/">campus golf course</a>.</p>
<p>
There is pleasant biking along the Rio Grande or anywhere through the pecan groves in rural Mesilla. Sometimes we organize bike trips on the weekend, such as heading out to Stahman's Pecan Farm for an ice cream break. People in the department also compete in <a href="http://www.trifind.com/nm.html">races, biathlons, and triathlons</a> as individuals and as teams. Just to name a few, we have had students enter the Wind Triathlon (April at the White Sands Missile Range), the Spring Forward 5K run (April on campus), the Raptor Duathlon (April at the Holloman Air Force Base), the Ruidoso Triathalon (June in Ruidoso), the Elephant Man Triathalon (September at Elephant Butte), and the Snowman 5K run (December on campus). </p>
<p>
The nearby Organ mountains provide plenty of places to hike, climb, and camp, nearby (at La Cueva & Dripping Springs, Aguirre Springs, Organ Needle, Baylor Canyon, Soledad Canyon, Organ Peak, and the Pine Loop Trail) and further away (at the <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/!ut/p/c5/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gjAwhwtDDw9_AI8zPwhQoY6IeDdGCqCPOBqwDLG-AAjgb6fh75uan6BdnZaY6OiooA1tkqlQ!!/dl3/d3/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS9ZQnZ3LzZfMjAwMDAwMDBBODBPSEhWTjBNMDAwMDAwMDA!/?ss=110306&navtype=forestBean&navid=091000000000000&pnavid=null&cid=null&ttype=main&pname=Gila%20National%20Forest%20-%20Home">Gila National Park</a>, <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/lincoln/">Lincoln National Forest</a>, <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/las_cruces/three_rivers.html">Three Rivers Petroglyphs Park</a>, Ruidoso, and Cloudcroft). There is also good climbing/bouldering at Hueco Tanks, Percha Creek, Rough 'n Readies, <a href="http://www.gilawilderness.com/travel/cityofrocks.htm">City of Rocks</a>, and The Tunnel. </p>
<p>
In general Southern New Mexico offers a variety of stunning natural attractions and parks. A little over an hour North of Las Cruces are the gypsum dunes of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/whsa">White Sands National Monument</a>. You can hike and bike the park's trails, sled down the white dunes, and watch the full Moon rise during the summer. Close to home near the Mexican border is the explosive volcanic crater, <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/las_cruces/kilbourne_hole.html">Kilbourne Hole</a>, which is known for excellent <a href="http://www.mtlilygems.com/mineinfo/KHinfo.html">rock hunting</a>. A slightly longer drive of 3.5 hours East will get you to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cave/">Carlsbad caverns</a>, cousin of the gypsum dunes of White Sands. Incidentally, if you are interested in skiing, don't despair! The gorgeous Rocky Mountain town of <a href="http://www.ruidoso.net/">Ruidoso</a> is home to <a href="http://www.skiapache.com/">Ski Apache</a> and there are more ski places to the North of Albuquerque. </p>
So, you came here for astronomy, right? NMSU enjoys proximity to some excellent observatories. The astronomy department maintains the <a href="http://www.apo.nmsu.edu/">Apache Point Observatory</a>, home to the 3.5m, the <a href="http://www.sdss3.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> telescopes, and the robotic NMSU 1m. APO shares dorm facilities with the <a href="http://nsosp.nso.edu/">Sunspot</a> solar observatory on the neighboring Sacramento peak. A leisurely 2 hour drive North will get you to the <a href="http://www.vla.nrao.edu/">Very Large Array</a>, which is West of the small town of Socorro. Slightly further and incidentally in Arizona, is the <a href="http://www.noao.edu/kpno/">Kitt Peak National Observatory</a> just outside Tucson. Interested in amateur astronomy? While going any direction outside of Las Cruces will give you the dark skies the Southwest is famed for, we have used the dark sky site in about 45 minutes away in Upham for occasional sky parties. Since it amounts to a clearing in the middle of the desert, it can be tricky to get to the first time, so we recommend <a href="images/Upham_directions.jpg">these directions</a>. The Upham site is more regularly used by the <a href="http://aslc-nm.org/">Astronomical Society of Las Cruces</a>, the local amateur astronomy group founded 60 years ago. If you would like a different location, try <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=I-10+W&daddr=32.251717,-107.065845&hl=en&ll=32.255963,-107.064514&spn=0.021158,0.029011&sll=32.28727,-106.914845&sspn=0.338417,0.464172&geocode=Fayc7AEdPneh-Q%3BFUUf7AEdC06e-Q&oq=Las+Cruces&t=h&mra=dme&mrsp=0&sz=11&z=15">here</a>. Keep driving until you see a little area to pull over on the left with a barbed wire fence and before one of the cattle gratings.
