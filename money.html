<a name="gsrp"></a><strong><a href="http://fellowships.hq.nasa.gov/gsrp/nav/">NASA Graduate Student Researchers Program (GSRP)</a></strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;"><br />
<strong>Deadline March</strong><br />
<strong>Starts in May and runs 1 year with a chance of renewal for 2 more years for a Ph. D. (1 more year for a Masters)</strong>
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: International students are ineligible for the NASA GSRP fellowship.</font>
</p>
<p>The NASA GSRP is a fellowship awarded to a select group of graduates every year. The award is typically for $27,000 a year with an additional $3,000 for adviser discretionary funds. The discretionary funds may be spent on supplies for research such as books; however, it's more typical for the money to be spent on travel to professional conferences. Computers can not be purchased with the discretionary funds. Awardees are expected to submit a series of reports documenting their progress and spend 10 weeks at their NASA center.
</p>
The process for applying to this fellowship can be time consuming, therefore, it's recommended that graduates applying for this fellowship prepare well in advance. In particular, you must find a researcher at a NASA institution who will collaborate with you and act as your GSRP adviser. First time applicants are required to submit:
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<li>A five-page project proposal with an additional abstract</li>
<li>A budget</li>
<li>Official undergraduate and graduate transcripts</li>
<li>Letter of recommendation from the student's adviser</li>
<li>A signature form signed by student, student's adviser, and NASA adviser</li>

<br />
<a name="grfp"></a><strong><a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)</a></strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;"><br />
<strong>Deadline November</strong><br />
<strong>Starts in April and runs for 3 years</strong>
<p>Fewer grad students are awarded the GRFP. The award is typically for $30,000 a year with an additional $10,500 cost-of-education allowance and also includes access to the TeraGrid supercomputing network. This award is intended for new graduate students, so students who have completed 1 year of graduate study are ineligible. Once you have been awarded the GRFP, you may not apply for it again. If you are funded via NSF, you will have a few <a href="nmnmsu.html#nsf">additional complications</a> in dealing with NMSU. </p>
Applicants are required to submit:
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<li>A series of essays (Personal statement, previous research experience, proposed plan of research) each no more than 2 pages and an optional Program Eligibility essay no more than 1 page</li>
<li>Official undergraduate and graduate transcripts</li>
<li>3 reference letters</li>

Previous award winners (namely Laura Mayorga, Carlos Vargas, and Kenza Arraki) have put together <a href="./ApplyingfortheNSFadvice.pdf">a guide</a> for applying.

<a name="nmsg" id="nmsg"></a><strong><a href="http://www.nmspacegrant.com/graduate_research_fellowships.php">New Mexico Spacegrant Graduate Research Fellowship</a></strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;"><br />
<strong>Deadline March</strong><br />
<strong>Starts in September and runs year with a chance of renewal for 1 year</strong>
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: International students are ineligible for the NASA GSRP fellowship.</font>
</p>
<p>The NM Spacegrant is a common source of funding for grads in the astronomy department here at NMSU. The award is $10,000 over the course of two semesters and graduates may receive up to 2 years of funding via Spacegrant. The award is offered in the Fall and Spring; therefore, graduates can apply in either semester. Spacegrant often is used as summer salary for students if they are already teaching in the Fall and Spring. The application is less rigorous than the NASA GSRP; however, a short presentation of your research is required every year for recipients. These are usually low stress presentations given in the Sugerman Space Grant Building on campus.
</p>
SpaceGrant goes directly into your account without the department's being notified. It's yours, personally, and you are taxed for it as income.  <strong>There are no restrictions on how you spend this money</strong>, so you can spend it on tuition, computers, programs, rent, food, alcohol, and even <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/chenille-fuzzy-chicks-a2-26_735.fltr">chenille chickies</a>. This means there are no grounds for an adviser to tell you how to use the money. If, for instance, they say they will not pay you for the summer and that you should use SpaceGrant as summer salary, at that point you are effectively self-employed and can do whatever you want.

<a name="nmsgre" id="nmsgre"></a><strong><a href="http://www.nmspacegrant.com/grants.php">New Mexico Spacegrant Research Enhancement Grant</a></strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;"><br />
<strong>Deadline December (Notice of Intent), February (Proposal due)</strong><br />
<strong>Starts in September and runs 1 year</strong>
<p>
<font color="#ff0000">NOTE: International students are ineligible for the NASA GSRP fellowship.</font>
</p>
<p>The award is typically for $25,000 a year provided by NASA EPSCoR. To our knowledge, no one has been awarded the Research Enhancement Grant, but this is regretfully due to lack of applications. The process for applying to this fellowship is time consuming, so it's recommended that graduates applying for this fellowship prepare well in advance. Letters of Intent should include the title of your proposed research program and a short summary description of the work involved. Like the NASA GSRP this grant requires the support of a NASA researcher. It may be tough to find someone with appropriate interests, or they may be busy with other projects, so begin looking for a NASA representative as soon as you decided to apply for this grant.</p>
Applicants are required to submit:
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<li>A five-page project proposal (along with Cover Page, Table of Contents, and 250 word abstract)</li>
<li>Budget</li>
<li>Letter of support from a NASA Field Center or Mission Directorate</li>

<strong>Deadline April</strong><br />
<strong>Starts date flexible (mid-Summer/Early Fall) and runs for 1 year with a chance of renewal for 2 additional years </strong>
<p>This Fellowship provides a stipend to graduate students interested in carrying out all or part of their thesis research under the supervision of a Carnegie Staff member in residence at Carnegie. It includes a stipend of $29,000 to cover housing and living expenses. Applications are encouaged from grad students doing research in observational astronomy, theoretical astrophysics, or instrumentation development. Major areas of research include cosmology and the distance scale, physics of active galactic nuclei, searches for massive black holes, galaxy formation and evolution, galaxy groups and clusters, intergalactic medium, star formation, supernovae, star clusters, and nucleosynthesis and chemical abundances of stars. Coursework and qualifying exams (orals) must be completed prior to arriving at Carnegie.</p>
Applicants are required to submit:

<div style="margin-left:20px;"><br />
<strong>Deadline March and October</strong><br />
<strong>Starts in May and December and runs 1 year</strong>
<p>The Sigma Xi GIAR awards up to $1,000 to students from all areas of the sciences and engineering. Designated funds from the National Academy of Sciences allow for grants of up to $5,000 for astronomy research and $2,500 for vision related research. Students use the funding to pay for travel expenses to and from a research site, or for purchase of non-standard laboratory equipment necessary to complete a specific research project. Note that this grant will not pay for computers or conference travel, but does help with travel to and from research sites such as observatories or to work with collaborators.
</p>
Also, dues paying members of the Sigma Xi or those students whose advisers are dues paying members will get a much greater consideration for the award. Therefore, be sure to ask your adviser if he/she is a dues paying member.

<strong>Starts in February and runs to July, starts August and runs to February</strong>
<p>The AAS offers an NSF-funded travel grant to international meetings. The application form requires that you submit a price quote and airline for your plane ticket. This grant works like getting money from ASNMSU: you are reimbursed based on receipts you submit after the conference.

<a name="nmsu"></a><h3>NMSU Funding</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Astronomy graduates frequently attend conferences, travel to observatories, go on job interviews, and many other prohibitively costly endeavors in the effort to further their careers. To help cover some of these expenses for graduate students, the University has many potential funding sources. The following road-map is generally how graduates should look to recover some of their money. Note that these options are equally valid for international students as well.</p>
<a name="adviser"></a><strong>Your Adviser</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>The first step any graduate student takes in understanding their funding starts with their adviser. First, speak with your adviser to understand the expected budget and how much money you may need to ask from the remaining sources of funding. Depending on the adviser you may be able to get all of the necessary funding through them or through your own personal grants or fellowships.
  Also, ask you adviser about their nominating you for any of the following <a href="http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/gradschool/announcements.html">Graduate School awards</a>:<br />

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
The Astronomy department offers several <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/dept/html/academics.awards.shtml">awards</a> for research, teaching, and outreach. Nominations may be submitted by faculty and students, and self-nominations are also accepted. Encourage your friends to nominate you for these awards!<ul>
<li><strong>Zia Award (yearly)</strong> for  research awesomeness</li>
<li><strong>Pegasus Award (yearly)</strong> for  teaching awesomeness</li>
<li><strong>Rappaport Award (bi-yearly)</strong> for  public outreach awesomeness or completion of an exceptional observational research project</li>
<li><strong>Murrell Award (yearly)</strong> for  research  or professional development awesomeness</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div><br />
<a name="gradtravel"></a><strong>Graduate School Conference Travel Award</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
 <p>The Graduate School has small <a href="http://www.gradschool.nmsu.edu/gradschool/Conference_Travel_Award.html">Conference Travel Awards</a>  that can be used on top of any money from ASNMSU, GSC, advisers, etc. The amount varies: up to $150 for in-state travel, up to $350 for out-of-state travel, and up to $600 for international travel. You can get this award multiple times, but the total of the Conference Travel Awards you recieve can't be more than $600 during your time at NMSU. These awards are limited in number and typically run out well before the end of Spring Semester, so  it's highly recommended that you act early submitting the forms for this award.<br />
   <br />
   Applicants are required to submit: </p>
 <ul>
  <li>a <a href="http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/forms/TravelGrantform.pdf">form</a> with signatures</li>
<li>a letter from your adviser</li>
<li>proof that you're attending the conference (registration receipt or conference proceedings listing your poster/talk are sufficient)</li>
<li>&quot;supporting funds from the department/academic college&quot;, which  can mean the department offers as little as $20</li>
</ul>
 Submit your application at least a month before the conference and then get reimbursed for your expenses. To get reimbursed <strong>submit your receipts to the astro department secretaries; <font color="#ff0000">do not send your receipts to the grad school.</font></strong>
</div>
<br />

<a name="astravel"></a><strong>Arts &amp; Sciences Conference Travel Award</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>The College of Arts &amp; Sciences
also provides funding for travel to conferences, meetings, and workshops. They say their awards give between $500 and $1000, but this is to be used only for travel expenses. You can only get this award once every two years, and it doesn't prevent you from asking for money from other sources (like the <a href="#gradtravel">Grad School</a>, <a href="#asnmsu">ASNMSU</a>, <a href="#gsc">GSC</a>, or <a href="#dept">the department</a>). Deadlines are midsemester, so March 1st for Spring semester.<br />
<br />
Applicants are required to submit in electronic form to jbrown at nmsu.edu the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>application stating importance of conference, benefit to student, nature of the presentation (poster, talk, dance, etc.), whether you were an invited speaker or not, and whether the presentation is part of your collaboration with peers or mentors</li>
<li>signature of department head on your application &quot;acknowledging awareness that the student will be presenting/performing at a conference workshop or meeting. Heads may state in an attachment whether the department is also giving funds for travel. A match or contribution is not required.&quot;</li>
<li>proof that your poster/talk/dance was accepted for presentation (either your confirmation email or the page of the program with your listing)</li>
<li>proof that you attended the conference (conference receipt is good)</li>
<li>budget clearly showing travel expenses</li>
</ul>

<a name="asnmsu"></a><strong>Associated Students of New Mexico State University (ASNMSU)</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
  <p><a href="http://asnmsu.nmsu.edu/">ASNMSU</a> is the student government here at NMSU. Every year, graduates and undergraduates pay ASNMSU hundreds of thousands of dollars in student fees. In exchange, ASNSMU uses these student fees for many shared services such as the activity center, career placement center, Aggie Shuttle, counseling, cultural activities, child care, and many others. One way to get our student fees back is to request money for travel, conference fees, transportation, etc. To do this, you are required to have a graduate senator to write a bill for you and then you shepherd the bill through various meetings (explained below). Your conference or travel must take place after the passage of the bill, so this process must be done <strong>well in advance of your trip</strong>. It can take upwards of more than a month to learn if your bill has passed.</p>
  <p>The ASNMSU Financial Procedures Guide is given out every Fall and the <a href="index.html#president">AGSO President</a> and <a href="index.html#treasurer">Treasurer</a> must attend these meetings if we're going to get any funding. They give out three documents: <a href="asnmsufinproc.pdf">Financial Procedures</a>, <a href="asnmsuquick.pdf">Quick Guide to Funding</a>, and <a href="asnmsuprivstuorg.pdf">Privileges of Student Organizations</a>. </p>
  Comments on what is and isn't funded by ASNMSU:
  <ul>
<li><strong>Individual and groups may attend conferences</strong>. Generally, ASNMSU will fund everyone who presents at a conference and only two additional people who aren't presenting. If the trip is something like AAS where many students may attempt to attend the conference and want money from ASNMSU, it's a good idea to have one person take care of a bill for all of the students (rather than every student submitting their own bill).</li><br />
<li><strong>Share hotel rooms</strong>. ASNMSU likes to use hotels rooms efficiently, four people to a room, and would not fund three rooms for three people. Also, in order to get money from ASNMSU for hotels, men and women cannot share a room.</li><br />
<li><strong>Advisers are not covered</strong>. ASNMSU uses student fees to fund students, not advisers.</li><br />
<li><strong>Per diem and food are not covered</strong>. ASNMSU does not provide a per diem and won't pay for food.</li><br />
<li><strong>Foreign travel is funded</strong>. For travels outside of North America, you will need two bills: one for U.S. expenses and one for foreign expenses. This means you end up needing twice the number of community service hours.</li><br />
  </ul>
  Some guidelines in obtaining money from ASNMSU:
  <ul>
<li><strong>Plan ahead</strong>. Do not wait to the last minute to submit a bill! It can take more than a month to get a bill past the senate and signed by the ASNMSU President (who has ultimate veto power on any bill). Your bill will not be passed if your trip occurs before your bill is passed. It is suggested that you start the process <font color="#ff0000">at least two months prior to your trip</font>. Also, leaving more time allows you opportunities to use the remaining funding sources should your bill fail to pass. <font color="#ff0000"><strong>Watch out for Summer events.</strong></font> ASNMSU does not meet in the summer. Therefore, if your trip takes place in the summer, please plan well ahead of time and discuss all due dates with your senator before the Spring semester ends.</li><br />
<li><strong>Ask a senator</strong>. You must ask a <a href="http://asnmsu.nmsu.edu/college-of-graduate">graduate senator</a> to sponsor a bill for you and submit it to the senate. You will need to provide <a href="ASNMSUFundingInformation.pdf">some information</a> to them, such as the dates and locations of your conference, and you'll have to estimate the cost of any tickets, hotel rooms, taxis, etc.. We've found Senators Charlene Shroulote and Hank Strevel to be helpful and reliable. However, you should be proactive and keep asking them if they need any more information or need you to attend a meeting.</li><br />
<li><strong>Plan all types of transportation into the bill</strong>. ASNMSU can cover transportation costs in the bill, but be sure to always ask for a receipt if you want to be reimbursed. Also, ASNMSU reimburses for mileage ($.50/mi) for any driving you do, even if it's only to and from the airport. They also reimburse for airport parking.</li><br />
<li><strong>Be clear about whether or not you are getting GSC funds</strong>. Unless you say otherwise ASNMSU assumes that you're getting some GSC money and takes it off the total of the bill.</li><br />
<li><strong>Have your community service forms ready</strong>. There are two ways to have community service: for every $3,000 requested each person must have 5 hours of community service in the past 180 days (that's 180 days not counting holidays or summer/winter breaks), or 25% of AGSO members must do 2 hours on-campus and 2 hours off-campus. The second way confuses everyone because different grad students do hours at different events. The Community Affairs chair (who makes the final decision) <strong>strongly prefers 5 hours per individual for every $3,000 requested. <font color="#ff0000">You have to hand in your community service forms to the Community Affairs chair before you go to the Community Affairs meeting.</font></strong> Make sure you or your senator turns the forms in on time. This meeting will be scheduled when you work with your graduate senator to submit the bill. In order to know who in AGSO did which events, be sure to ask the <a href="index.html#vp">AGSO Vice-President</a> for all public service event paperwork and make copies of them. Need community service hours? Check out your options on the <a href="obsout.html">Observatory & Outreach page.</a></li><br />
<li><strong>For those who aren't presenting something at the event</strong>: You also need to have a signed letter from your adviser which <strong>must</strong> include your name, the conference info (name, location, date, number of concurrent sessions), and your reasons for attending.
</li>
</ul>
Your bill must make it through <a href="ASNMSUFlowchart.pdf"><strong>four  meetings</strong></a>: Community Affairs Committee, Rules Committee,  Finance Committee, and the Senate. You are only required to attend the first, Community Affairs, which ensures that your outreach hours satisfy the bill's requirements. Come prepared to give a brief description of the event, why you want to attend, and a description of your community service. While you are not required to attend the Senate meeting, where the final vote on your bill is done, it is highly recommended. Reasonable bills that have made it that far nearly always get passed if a representative is present. Again, be prepared to give a brief description of the event to the Senate.
<ul>
<li><strong>If the bill does not pass the senate, it dies</strong>. You should consult with your Senator for advice on different alternatives. You will be responsible for all expenses you proposed for in the bill. This is a rare occurence, and if it does occur it may be more efficient to seek other means of funding as described in the remaining sections.</li><br />
<li><strong>If the bill passes, it will be sent to the ASNMSU President for approval</strong>. The ASNMSU President has two weeks in which to approve or veto the bill. If the President approves the bill, the funds will be transferred into your ASNMSU account by the Comptroller's office after verifying the matching funds. If the President vetoes the bill, no funds will be transferred unless the ASNMSU Senate overrides the veto by a two-thirds vote.</li><br />
<li><strong>Save all receipts</strong>. In order to get reimbursed for the expenses listed on the bill, you must have receipts.</li>
  </ul>
  After your trip how do you get your reimbursement? The more organized you are, the faster you will get your reimbursement. <font color="#ff0000">If you dump a pile of receipts on their desk, you will only get a headache.</font>
  <ul>
<li><strong>Call the  Accountant to check the paperwork.</strong> Save yourself some time and call the Acountant's Office (6-4415) to ensure the bills are signed and ready to go. Ask them explicity if they have a copy of your bill (provide the bill number) and if it has been signed by the president yet.</li><br />
<li><strong>Take copies of the receipts to the  Accountant.</strong> Do not give receipts to your senator. Receipts must be turned into the Accountant's Office in ASNMSU headquarters within Corbett Center Student Union. Call the Accountant's Office (6-4415) before you walk over, though; tell them you are bringing receipts for reimbursement and explicitly ask if they will still be there by the time you arrive.</li><br />
<li><strong>Provide conversion rates for any receipts that aren't in US dollars.</strong></li><br />
<li><strong>You may also need credit card statements.</strong> Sometimes the comptrollers ask to see proof that you paid your receipts (weird, huh?). For example, a slip of paper on official letterhead from the conference saying that you attended and were charged the registration amount is insufficient; you must also bring a credit card statement showing that you did, indeed, pay registration.</li><br />
<li><strong>Airline reimbursement requires your itinerary as well</strong>. Even if you present your boarding passes and receipt for your airline ticket, you will only be reimbursed if you also show your itinerary (weird, huh?).</li><br />
<li><strong>You will need to provide starting and ending mileage to get reimbursed for driving.</strong></li>
  </ul>

<a name="gsc"></a><strong>Graduate Student Council (GSC)</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>The <a href="http://web.nmsu.edu/~wwwgsc/">GSC</a> is a group within ASNMSU that exists to help graduate students get funding. They also host the <a href="http://web.nmsu.edu/~wwwgsc/gras/">Graduate Research and Arts Symposium (GRAS)</a> each year. The GSC funding guidelines can be accessed from the <a href="http://web.nmsu.edu/~wwwgsc/">GSC website</a>; however, be sure to ask the <a href="index.html#gsorep">AGSO GSC Rep.</a> about funding procedures to make sure that your knowledge is up to date. Keep in mind that the GSC requests that graduates attempt to get money from ASNMSU before the GSC. The reason is simply that ASNMU has more money in the pot, and the GSC can quickly run out of funds by graduates seeking funds at the last minute. </p>
<p>You can get GSC funding to attend a conference regardless of whether or not you present at the conference, but you can only receive funding from the GSC once a semester. For each individual request for funding, that person must attend at least two GSC meetings (the meeting during which the funding is requested and another meeting after that). The GSC can retroactively refund a conference that occured up to 90 days before the funding request. Anyone getting money from the GSC must present at <a href="http://web.nmsu.edu/~wwwgsc/gras/">GRAS</a>.</p>
<p>For an application with one individual: if you're requesting &lt;$200, then the GSC will give you $200 or less. If you're requesting &gt;$200, then the GSC will give you 50% of your costs but won't give you more than $500. For an application with 2 or more people, the total amount the GSC will fund is $1000.</p>
<p><strong>You can apply to both ASNMSU and GSC for funding:</strong> ASNMSU will fund 0.49*(total - GSC funds). Since you can only apply for GSC funding once a semester, use this option for your most expensive trip.</p>
You must submit your application to the GSC 3 weeks prior to your departure (or by the second to last GSC meeting before your departure, whatever is first). <strong>Please read the <a href="http://web.nmsu.edu/~wwwgsc/funding.html"> application guidelines</a> carefully: <font color="#ff0000">if you don't provide all of the requested information, your funding request may be denied.</font></strong> Also, make sure your cost estimates are accurate: if your cover letter specifies a certain amount for hotel or airfare, you should provide receipts for that amount. If you didn't spend at least 90% of any GSC money allotted to you in a previous semester, the GSC may not fund your request. Your application must include the following:
<ul>
<li>Funding Appropriation form (don't leave blanks!)</li>
<li>Community Service forms showing that each individual on the funding request has completed 3 hours of community service. The GSC consideres community service as expiring after 120 days (not counting holidays or summer/winter breaks).</li>
<li>Cover letter explaining exactly what the funding will be used for (airfare, lodging, etc.), where the student is traveling, what conference/event the student is attending, why the student is attending, and dates of travel</li>
<li>Official conference program, itinerary, or announcement OR a letter from your adviser/collaborator stating where you are going for research and your dates of travel</li>
<li>Receipt for registration for each person (if applicable)</li>
<li>Hotel information (including room rate, number of people per room, etc.) (if applicable)</li>
</ul>

<p>
GSOs that want money for a group (rather than an individual) requires "points" in addition to the standard community service. These points come from attending GSC meetings and having officers on the board. For each AGSO funding request, the <a href="index.html#gsorep">AGSO GSO Rep</a>. must attend at least two GSC meetings during which the funding is requested and another meeting after that. This is usually not an issue, however, because we require the AGSO <a href="index.html#gsorep">GSO Rep.</a> to attend every GSC meeting. </p>
