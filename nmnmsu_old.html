<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
<img src="images/nmsumontage.jpg" width="203" height="309" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />
Welcome to the department! We think you made a good choice! Throughout your years at NMSU you'll need to visit various buildings (Educational Services, Corbet, Physical Sciences, etc.), so we suggest using <a href="http://maps.nmsu.edu/">maps.nmsu.edu</a> to navigate rather than hurting your eyes with NMSU's <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/General/Maps/">sucky campus map</a>. For finding contact information you can use NMSU's online <a href="https://accounts.nmsu.edu/accounts/phonebook/">phonebook</a>. </p>
We, your fellow grad students, have two requirements of first year students:
<ol>
<li><strong>Serve as an AGSO officer in your second year:</strong> In your second year you will be elected to one of the officer positions via the vindictive democratic process of an AGSO meeting. Consider it community service for having these things taken care of for you during your hectic first year.</li><br />
<li><strong>Attend colloquium &amp; pizza lunch:</strong> Why attend these talks? After all at the start/end of a busy week of classes, labs, and homework, no one wants to spend an hour at a talk on a topic you know nothing about, right? Wrong! It's important to learn something completely different, and this is material you won't get in class. Even if you don't understand the whole talk, you'll have gotten more than if you didn't go. Since colloquium speakers took the time to travel here and give a talk, they deserve an hour and your respect (especially since at some point that will be you). Also, the faculty notice who attends (or doesn't attend); by  skipping out you make the rest of us look bad.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name="exams"></a>
<h3>Help with Cumes and Classwork Orals</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
To help with studying for cumes and orals, we've gathered all previous exams and questions into a few binders:
<p>
<strong>Cume Book</strong>:  If you borrow this binder, make your photocopies/lists/notes and return it as soon as possible. Thanks to our tireless <a href="index.html#cumeczar">Cume Czar</a>, we now have an <a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/cume_book/">online copy of the Cume book</a>. The website will only be accessible through computers connected to the internet within the astronomy department. The exams may be viewed from home if you ssh into the astro cluster and navigate to /home/httpd/html/cume_book however not all exams are there. Check the file missing.txt for the list of partial, missing, or unidentified cumes.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Orals Book</strong>: Same deal as the Cume Book but not in fancy digital format. Please return it as soon as you are finished, for people who are studying for their classwork orals do not enjoy hunting down the orals book and are less than polite when they find it's been under your desk for a month. After you take your classowork orals, remember to add your questions.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Thesis Proposal Book</strong>: Same as the Orals Book, but contains everyone's thesis proposal. When it comes time to write your own, it's a good idea to flip through this to get an idea of what they look like. Keep in mind that unlike your thesis/dissertation, there is no template to use. The length and level of detail in your proposal is basically whatever your advisor thinks is good enough. To get an idea of what the structure and contents of your proposal should be like, you should start by reading through past proposals written by other students who have worked with your advisor. More recent proposals can be found in an online version <a href="proposal_book.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Snake Book</strong>: Same as the previous books but containing the questions asked by the committee behine closed doors after your defense talk. It's named for the traditional <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/faq-the-snake-fight-portion-of-your-thesis-defense">snake fight</a> that occurs during this meeting. After your victory, add your questions to the binder. 
</div>
<a name="dept"></a>
<h3>Department Resources: Meals,  Wheels, and More</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>
Being part of the department means that you have a lot of computer-related resources available!  Check the <a href="compweb.html">computing page</a> for more information on servers, programs, copiers, printers, email, and webages. As an NMSU student you have access to the many talks and learning series from the <a href="http://www.teaching.nmsu.edu/">Teaching Academy</a>, which are useful for improving your writing, speaking, teaching, and research skills. </p>
<p>
When using the department credit card (Pcard), you must provide a receipt for Lorenza to upload. 
NMSU is a tax-exempt institution so you don't have to pay tax on goods, only on services.
To honor the tax exemption on  purchases please feel free to direct vendors to our <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~purchase/WebDocs%202011/Tax%20exemption%20notice.pdf">tax exempt notice</a> and <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~purchase/WebDocs%202011/request%20for%20tax%20certificate.pdf">tax exempt certificate</a>.
If you have any questions or run into issues, please feel free to contact Lorenza for assistance.  There are some limits on credit card use: $2,500 limit per transaction and $10,000 per billing cycle.  Also, there's a limit of $999.99 per item; if you want something that costs more individually, you'll have to get a purchase order.  The Pcard can only be used for registration, not for airfare, hotel, or any other travel expense.  Be aware, grants and contracts sometimes have other restrictions, be sure you check with Lorenza before you make a purchase.</p>
When taking prospective students and colloquium speakers out to a meal, keep these rates in mind. The university will not reimburse for amounts exceeding the maximum established rates. Reimbursement for meals with Colloquium speakers will be limited to four department personnel (faculty, students, others) plus the speaker.

<img src="images/carkeys.jpg" width="200" height="383" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />
<a name="driving"></a>If you take the <a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/~safety/training/description/class_desc_ddc.htm#Defensive_Driving">NMSU defensive driving course</a>, whose $40 fee will be reimbursed by the department, you can drive the two department cars or rent a vehicle from the <a href="http://nmsuparking.com/Rental.html">university motor pool</a>. The vehicle can be used for more distant public events, going to APO, or even driving to Austin for AAS in a 15-person van. Keys for the department vehicles are inside the server room (Ay 116A) just next to the door. <strong>If you want to use either car, first check the calendar</strong> to ensure no one else reserved it for the time you want it; if you're in the clear, write on the calendar when you'll have the car. Replace the keys with your name tag (if you don't have a name tag, ask the office staff for one). Before you go see the office staff so they can instruct you on how to use the gas card. To keep track of useage and billing, there is a clipboard in the driver's side door. <strong>Before your trip write down your name, the date, the starting mileage, and the account which will pay for your use of the car (usually 'dept' for astro stuff, but sometimes the Teaching Academy or something else); after your trip indicate the ending mileage. </strong></p>
<p>
You already know about the cume system, but you should also know that Ofelia keeps all of your old cumes. It's a good idea to see them to check your score (beyond pass/fail) and correct your mistakes. Ofelia also keeps all of your TA evaluations, except for online evals, which the department head keeps.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the books stored in the Tea Time Room (Ay 207), there are some textbooks stored in the upstairs printer room (Ay 217).
This collection of books is sometimes referred to as the Grad Student Library. Our department subscribes to a number of journals, giving you access to articles online and in the libraries on campus. Check the <a href="http://yw2pn3mr9l.search.serialssolutions.com/?V=1.0&amp;L=YW2PN3MR9L&amp;S=T_AZ&amp;C=A&amp;N=100&amp;B=3800">list</a> for your favorites!</p>
<p> Each office has a recycling bin. The university picks up recycling from the building every Friday. They collect white paper, clear plastic (1 & 2), aluminum cans, non-food-related cardboard (shipping boxes, not pizza boxes), and also batteries. If you have any batteries you'd like to dispose of, tape over the positive end and give it to Lorenza or Ofelia.</p>
</div>
<a name="parking"></a><h3>Parking on Campus</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
Many of the undergrad students drive in from El Paso, which means competition for a close parking spot can be fierce. The good news: there are free parking lots near the Pan Am center. Also, the parking lots are free after 4:30pm and all Saturday and Sunday (but not over holidays like Thanksgiving Break). The parking lots are color-coded by permit, so check <a href="http://nmsuparking.com/Maps.html">the map</a> to see what permits cover what parking lots. How do you get a permit?
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nmsuparking.com/permit2.html">Parking Dept website</a></li>
<li>At the Parking Department located at the corner of E College Ave. and Union Ave. (adjacent the Police Dept.)<br />
Open 8 a.m. - 5 p.m. Monday-Friday Aug. 16-20 and Aug. 23-27</li>
<li>Corbett Center 2nd Floor Info Desk<br />
Open 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. Aug. 15 (Move-In Day)<br />
Open 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. Monday-Friday Aug. 16-20 and Aug. 23-27</li>
</ul>
If you want a permit before Aug. 15, use the <a href="http://nmsuparking.com/permit2.html">online service</a> or visit the Parking Dept. Give them a call 575-646-1839 for more information. Current parking permits expire Aug. 31, 2010 and a new permit will expire Aug. 31, 2011. </div>
<a name="hiring"></a><h3>The Hiring Process</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Each year the university "re-hires" you as a grad student. Some years, this has led to a delay in getting a paycheck. Ofelia and Lorenza laid out how the process works and what we can do to avoid delays. The main problem is that every department is trying to hire their students, and this slows down the admin staff. Here are some suggestions for how we can help our amazing office staff with this process:
</p><p>
We can help by registering for classes as soon as possible. We must be registered before we can be hired, so any delay might lead to a delay in your first few paychecks. Also, we should give Ofelia information about any kind of tuition awards we've earned, such as <a href="http://catalog.nmsu.edu/grad-2009-2010/07-funding/index.html">HED</a>, <a href="http://spacegrant.nmsu.edu/">NM Space Grant</a>, or anything else which would affect our pay. There are separate processes and additional irritations for the office staff to go through for these things. For instance, some students are funded entirely by fellowship, which means they aren't hired. There is an entirely separate method to go through so they get a monthly pay check. Also, an HED student is hired for 10 hours versus 20 like everyone else. The sources of funding vary from student to student and without this information, Ofelia and Lorenza cannot start the hiring process. Additionally, if awards are late in coming from the sponsors (i.e., giving the money to the university), the students won't get their stipend or tuition award. </p>
<p> Lorenza recommends that all students sign up for <a href="#deposit">direct deposit</a>.</p>
<p><a name="nsf"></a><strong>If you have your own funding (like NSF) and aren't hired by NMSU</strong>, you have a few more complications.  NMSU's a little weird about handling fellowships, so talk to Lorenza to get the details of how your paycheck works.  Taxes are not taken out of your 'paycheck', so you have to pony up your yearly taxes all at once in April.  You should receive at 1098-T from Accounts Receivable (6-4911).  If you were paid a stipend during the Summer, Accounts Payable (6-1189) should be sending you a 1099.  If there are any problems with these forms, when you call either office be sure to tell them that you are <strong>paid via stipend</strong> so they don't get confused.  Since you're not a Graduate Assistant (more like a self-paid free agent of research), you won't qualify for certain NMSU awards (such as the <a href="http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/gradschool/MikeWatts.html">Mike Watts Outstanding Leadership Fellowship</a>).</p>
</div>
<a name="health"></a><h3>Student Health Insurance</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
Wait, what about <a href="http://benefits.nmsu.edu/insurance/grad-health">student health insurance</a>? The deadline for hiring is early in September to secure a paycheck for the middle of that month, and this might seem frustrating when the deadline for enrolling in student health insurance is the end of August. However, August 31st is only the deadline to have the first premium taken from your first paycheck and the second from your second paycheck. You can still enroll in student health insurance before September 15th, but both premiums will be taken out of your next paycheck. Regardless of when you enroll in student health insurance, all coverage is retroactive to August 16th.
To be eligible for student health insurance, you need to do five things:
<ol>
<li>have completed <a href="http://training.nmsu.edu/registration/event.php?course=98">Graduate Assistant Orientation</a> (which all incoming grad students must do)</li>
<li>be hired in Banner for an academic semester for a total of a .25 FTE to a .50 FTE between all GA positions in a salary position (check with Lorenza or Ofelia about your hiring status)<br />
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
FTE stands for Full Time Equivalent. Grads are hired as 1 FTE during the year, meaning we can work no more than 40 hours a week. During the summer we are usually hired as .50 FTE which means we can work no more than 20 hours a week.
</div></li>
<li>be a full-time graduate student enrolled in at least 9 non-audited credits from NMSU</li>
<li>be in good academic standing</li>
<li>complete your online application<!--<a href="https://hrs-apps.nmsu.edu:8443/hrp/faces/login.xhtml">online application</a>--></li>
</ol>
</div>
<a name="deposit"></a><h3>Direct Deposit</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
This allows any credit balances on your student account to be transferred to the account you have provided. It avoids the hassle of going to Accounts Receivable when you have a credit balance. Getting direct deposit involes two parts: fill out the <a href="https://www.nmsu.edu/~payroll/Forms/DD_input.htm">Direct Deposit Authorization</a> form and then sign up on <a href="http://my.nmsu.edu/">myNMSU</a> by clicking the &quot;Student Accounts&quot; tab, clicking &quot;Direct Deposit Enrollment&quot;, and filling out your bank information. 
Each time you get paid, you will get an email with PDF attachment of your &quot;check&quot;. <strong>This PDF file is password protected</strong>: use (up to) the <strong>first four letters of your last name</strong> and the <strong>last four digits of your Social Security Number</strong>. </div>
<a name="tuition"></a>
<h3>Tuition</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Even though you're a grad student, you still pay tuition. You must pay 10% of your tuition balance before the first week of classes ends, or the university will automatically un-enroll you from your classes.
</p>
<p>
To qualify for in-state tuition after your first year, you need to <a href="taxresvote.html#residency">file for New Mexico residency</a>, and we recommend you do this during the Summer to avoid long lines at the Registrar's Office. While a few students have not established residency and have still gotten in-state tuition rates, this is due to luck and is more an exception than the rule.</p>
If you want to pay off your balance online, use NMSU's <a href="https://accounts.nmsu.edu/accounts/nmsupay/index.php">web payment system</a> instead of paying through my.nmsu. The former is a secure website (https) and the latter passes the info through an unsecured website (http). </div>
<a name="tpv"></a><h3>End of the Year Meeting with Faculty (TPV)</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>You have probably heard about the meeting with the faculty at the end of the year (referred to by students as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_in_The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Total_Perspective_Vortex">TPVs</a>).  The goal is to ensure open communication, to discuss ideas and possibilities for improving the program, and to discuss expectations for students and faculty.  They are meant to be a low-key forum for communication between faculty and students.
</p>
<p>
Instead of having individual meetings with students, there will be  separate group meetings with each of the first year, second year, and third year students and as many of the faculty present as possible.  These meetings will last about 30 minutes.  Each class should meet in advance to come up with general comments, suggestions, and questions.  The TPV will begin with  the students' points and then proceed to a discussion including expectations for the following year.</p>
<p>Obviously, if there are inter-student issues, this group format may not be a good place to bring them up. As a result, any individual student is welcome to request (via Jon) a meeting with the faculty, or an individual meeting with Jon. </p>
For 4th year and later students, students will meet with their committees. The primary advisor will draft a brief summary of how things are going. Students should take the initiative to set these meetings up and encourage the advisor to draft up and submit the notes to Jon immediately following the meeting.
</div>
<a name="summer"></a><h3>Changes During the Summer</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>To be eligable for the student FICA and Medicare tax exception, we must have full-time status (9 credit hours for grad students). This is still true during the Summer. Since many of us don't register for Summer classes, we end up paying the Social Security and Medicare taxes to the tune of 4.2% and 1.45%, respectively, from June 30th to August 31st
</p><p>
Full-time students pay a Health Fee. If you go to the <a href="http://wellness.nmsu.edu/chc/">Campus Health Center</a> during the Summer for an office visit, you'll have to dish out a co-pay. If you pick something up at the pharmacy, you must pay for it before leaving instead of putting it on your student account. </p>
The Activity Fee is also bundled with tuition for full-time students. To use the athletic facilities (gym, swimming pools, classes and fitness programs) during the Summer, you'll have to purchase an <a href="http://wellness.nmsu.edu/aggiefit/">AggieFit</a> membership ($40).
</div>
<a name="international"></a><h3>International Travel</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;"><img src="images/paris-rthamilt.jpg" width="216" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left" />
<p>
NMSU requires all students to fill out a <a href="http://international.nmsu.edu/travel-forms.html">form</a> 30 days prior to their departure. No travel is allowed to countries subject to <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html">Travel Warnings</a> issued by the US State Department. Give your form to Lorenza or Ofelia and they will submit it to the Dean of <a href="http://international.nmsu.edu/">International and Border Programs</a>. Puerto Rico is considered a foreign destination (go figure).</p>
<p>
This form mentions international health insurance. <strong>Even if you already have health insurance </strong>you must purchase the full blanket student accident and sickness insurance to travel to another country. It costs $45/month for students under 50 and $18/month for students over 50. Our department head has graciously allowed department funds to pay for this extra health insurance. When you give your form to the office staff, they'll make sure the correct billing number is on it.</p>
<p>If you're traveling to a conference, you can get funding via  the <a href="http://aas.org/grants/itg.php">AAS International Travel Grant</a>. Application deadlines are in June and January of each year.</p>
<p>Before you leave (actually, as soon as you know your travel dates), call your credit card (or debit card) company to let them know when and where you'll be traveling. This way your card won't be declined when they see a non-US charge. Even if you don't intend to use your card abroad, this is a good backup just in case you end up needing it.</p>
<img src="images/india-catwu.jpg" width="300" height="182" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />
<p>Make sure your electronics will work wherever you go.  In terms of electrons coming from the wall, most items that have a big blocky transformer (computers, cell phone chargers, etc.) will be able to convert from <a href="http://www.kropla.com/electric2.htm">120V/60Hz to 240V/50Hz</a>, however the <a href="http://www.eurocom.com/support/plugs.htm">outlet shape will vary by country</a>. Make sure you have the correct plug adaptor to make your North American 2- or 3-prong plug fit into wherever you go.</p>
Want to talk to home but won't have a strong enough internet connection for <a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/homepage">Skype</a>? If you have an iPhone or similar device, there is a free app called <a href="http://www.talkatone.com/faq.html">talkatone</a>. As long as you have access to a wifi network, this app uses your <a href="http://www.google.com/voice ">Google voice phone number</a>  to call any US number for free and your friends in the US can  call you for free. The connection is clearer than a normal phone call and you don't even use up minutes on your phone plan. Want to watch/listen Netflix or Pandora? For one week you can use <a href="http://www.unblock-us.com">UnblockUs</a> for free; after that you'll need to find another way to get your fix.
</div>




<a name="degree"></a><h3>Getting Your Degree</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>After earning your degree, you have to make sure NMSU actually gives it to you. NMSU has a <a href="http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/current/graduating-advanced-degree.html">short list of instructions</a> for getting your degree. This section expands on that. </p>

<strong>Setting up your committee</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
Your committee must include a "Dean's representative", a non-astronomy NMSU professor. This person ensures the process is fair and is usually someone from whom you've taken an out of department class. Non-NMSU committee members must be made honorary department members in the eyes of the university. This is something your adviser handles but be warned that the process takes time. Advise your adviser to start early.
</div><br />

<strong>Comprehensive exam</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">After you pass your cumes you will take your orals/comprehensive exam. The comprehensive exam is broken into two parts: an oral examination based on all your classwork, and a 10~15 page paper and oral presentation (and grilling behind closed doors) describing your proposed thesis research. Which one you do first is up to you. There are two forms you need to worry about, and we suggest you keep a copy of the forms after they've been signed, just in case the university loses them.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/forms/ExamForm_DoctorateofPhilosophy%20revised.pdf">Doctorate of Philosophy Examination form</a>: this is due <strong>no less than 10 days before</strong> your exam, so take care of it <strong>as soon as you pick a date for your classwork orals</strong>. Gather your signatures and turn it over to Graduate Student Services (PSL building).</li>
<li><a href="http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/forms/Program%20of%20Study_PhD.pdf">Doctoral Program of Study form</a>: this lists all the classes you've taken and <strong>all future courses</strong> you'll take to complete your degree, including Pre-Dissertation Research (ASTR 600) and Doctoral Dissertation (ASTR 700) credit.</li>
</ul>
</div><br />

<strong>Masters degree</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
You earn your Masters when you pass your thesis proposal, regardless of when the university gets around to sending you the piece of paper. To get the university to give you your degree, you need two forms. Again, keep copies of the final forms in case of a bureaucratic mishap.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/forms/Program of Study_Masters.pdf">Masters Program of Study form</a>: the classes listed should include Masters Thesis Credit (ASTR 599) and all other coursework but not Pre-Dissertation Research (ASTR 600) or Doctoral Dissertation (ASTR 700) credit. Have the Arts and Science Dean (Breland Hall) sign this and bring this and the next form to the Grad Student Services (EDS building).</li>
<li><a href="http://prospective.nmsu.edu/graduate/forms/Exam Fee Form revised2.pdf">Examination Fee form</a>: have Graduate Student Services (EDS buliding) sign this and the previous form, then bring this form to the Cashier (EDS building).</li>
</ul>
Applying for your masters degree will confuse the university, especially when you register for doctoral research credit the following semester. They will place a hold on your account. To clear it, go to Grad Student Services (Educational Services Building) and tell them you're continuing on to your PhD. Invariably, the grad schol will have problems recognizing your status as a dissertation student, especially after earning your Master's degree. Let Ofelia deal with the grad school, she knows how to bend them to her will.

<strong>Doctorate degree</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>For the thesis document itself, Jeff provided an amazing LaTeX template (<a href="NMSU-aastex-thesis-v1.2.tar.gz">tar ball</a>) which is compliant with NMSU's guidelines. After you successfully defend your thesis you should leave 3 weeks for revisions from your committee. NMSU offers a series of <a href="http://www.gradschool.nmsu.edu/Guidelines/">checklists and guides</a> to process of submitting your thesis for printing and getting your degree. The URLs mentioned in the text might not be correct, but a bit of searching should get you what you need. </p><p>
You should give a copy to Ofelia of any forms you turn in (from defense to submitting your revised dissertation. This way, when Grad Student Services called saying they don't have a form (meaning they lost it), Ofelia can fax it over and save you a hike across campus. Before your actual defense, you should call Grad Student Services to double check that they have all of the forms (in case of a last-minute loss of form, which is entirely possible).
</p>
<p>
You officially turn in your thesis to the graduate school (Physical Sciences Laboratory building) so they can check it for formatting issues: margins, proper figure/table captions, etc. If your margins aren't correct, they'll give it back to you and tell you to fix it, after which you'll have to resubmit it. Save yourself time and double-check your margins (break out that ruler!) after you print and before you turn it in to them. Watch Milen Bartnic's <a href="http://www.gradschool.nmsu.edu/mb/TDGWorkshop.html">video</a>. Submit your dissertation to him a day early, and he'll have it reviewed within an hour. Submit your dissertation to Milen at the Grad School office (Corbett Rm. 230), not the Graduate Student Services. If you're curious as to which office deals with what in the grad school, check out their <a href="http://gradschool.nmsu.edu">website</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-left:10px">
<strong>Note</strong>: For a given set of margins, the actual location of the text on your printed page will change whenever the printer gets retonered. Luckily, the margins don't seem to change when you refill the paper tray. </p>
<p>
If you need to make a few minor changes when you resubmit (aside from changes they request), they probably won't notice. However, you shouldn't have any significant changes to make. Remember, when you submit your thesis to the graduate school, you also give them a checklist. Some of the items on the checklist refer to having made all the changes requested by your committee. It seems that there isn't much else aside from margin size that the Grad School looks for, so some rules in the PDF you might be able to ignore. For example, the PDF demanded that the short descriptions used in the Table of Figures be identical to the first "sentences" in the figure captions; however you can get away with not doing this all the time.</p>
<p>Also, according to the checklist you need to have paid your binding fees before turning in your manuscript. This is ridiculous and you can safely ignore it. You are required to print four copies for binding. Their destinations:

<li> NMSU archives/library</li>
<li> Astronomy Department</li>
<li> Advisor</li>
<li> You</li></p>

<strong>Thesis Tips and Tricks</strong>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p><strong>Watch how many figures you use from other papers</strong>. Per copyright law you may only have 1 figure from each source. If you want multiple figures from a single source, you must obtain written permission as in the NMSU thesis guidelines.
</p>
<strong>Watch your writing style.</strong> For a professional appearance keep an eye out for these common mistakes in writing style:
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
Avoid passive voice: "The model calculated ...", "It calculated ..." should be "We modeled as ..."<br />
Watch your verb tense: write in past tense 'cos the work is already done (except for future work section)<br />
Avoid writing with "how": The sentence "We show an example of how we varied x in Figure 5" is not as good as "We vary x by a proscribed amount, as shown in Figure 5".<br />
</div>
<p>
<strong>Format when you start writing, not after you are done.</strong> It's easier to read through the formatting guidelines at the start of your writing and do things right the first time, rather than going through and re-formatting to appease the Graduate School.  On that note ...
 <strong><a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> is not your enemy.</strong> You will be using the powerful/straightfoward/backwards/frustrating typesetting laguage  to write your thesis. You should also learn to use <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authorsview.authors/elsart#bibtex">BibTeX</a>.
