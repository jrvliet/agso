<h3>Class Policies</h3>
<ul>
<strong>Attendance is mandatory.</strong> Arrive on time and expect to use the full 2 hours for lab.  Repeated late arrivals will result in a loss of points.
<br /><br />
<strong>Bring a copy of the lab </strong>and read it before you come to lab. Check the schedule to make sure you bring the correct lab, for we will not go through the labs in the same order as the Lab Manual.
<br /><br />
<strong>There will be no make-up labs</strong>; the only exception to this is for medical emergencies.  If you know in advance you will miss a lab, let me know and I can arrange something.
<br /><br />
<strong>Work together in groups of 3 or 4.</strong> Each group should submit one copy of their in-lab work with all members names on the top. Each group member must complete their take home section individually.
<br /><br />
<strong>Labs are due 1 week from when they are assigned.</strong> Late work is not accepted.  Each group turns in a copy of the lab, and every student turns in a summary.
<br /><br />
<strong>Plagiarism will not be tolerated.</strong> Do not copy from the Lab Manual, Wikipedia, your classmates, or any other source without citation.  Plagiarism will result in a zero for the lab; repeated instances of plagiarism will result in a zero for the class and a letter to the Dean.  Be aware of the Student Code of Conduct (<a href="http://www.nmsu.edu/Campus_Life/vpsa/public_html/SCOC/misconduct.html">http://www.nmsu.edu/Campus_Life/vpsa/public_html/SCOC/misconduct.html</a>).
</ul>
<h3>Campus Observatory</h3>
<ul>
You are required to go to the campus observatory twice  a semester.  The semester is split into halves, the dates of which are listedon the whiteboard in the classroom.  Bring four observatory sheets each time you go.  These sheets are in the back of your lab manual.  You will be shown four objects and will have to sketch and record information about them.  On your own you will look up a fact about them.
<br /><br />
The Tombaugh Observatory is located on campus on Williams Street by the track and the intermural fields.  The telescopes are in the white buildings with domes on top.  The observatory will not open it if it's cloudy.  Before you go check the observatory hotline (646-6278) or the observatory website (<a href="http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/astro/observatory/">http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/astro/observatory/</a>) to make sure it is open that night.
</ul>
<h3>Helpful Hints</h3>
<ul>
If you're confused, ask me for help!
<br /><br />
Answer every question and show your work: you can't get partial credit for not having an answer.
<br /><br />
Always write  units with your answers.
<br /><br />
Make sure you use your calculator properly: 2.6/2*PI is not the same thing as 2.6/(2*PI).
