<a name="housing"></a><h3>Housing</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Students rent apartments or houses all over Las Cruces and Mesilla, and a few students have bought houses. Some of these were found via <a href="http://lascruces.en.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a> or <a href="http://www.apartmentguide.com/">Apartment Guide</a>, but others were found by driving around town and investigating 'for rent' or 'for sale' signs. Not all apartment complexes have websites, but many are listed with contact information on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?near=1780+East+University+Avenue,+Las+Cruces,+NM+88003-1229+(New+Mexico+State+University)&amp;geocode=CfTDHQbDhZgRFcWS7AEdzh-j-SEtoA0tsOIh6Q&amp;q=apartments&amp;f=l&amp;dq=new+mexico+state+university,+las+cruces,+nm&amp;sll=32.281285,-106.750002&amp;sspn=0.018867,0.032015&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=apartments&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=32.284593,-106.747026&amp;spn=0.035047,0.069866&amp;z=14">googlemaps</a>. The student government, <a href="http://asnmsu.nmsu.edu/">ASNMSU</a>, provides a free handbook to educate you about your options, recourses, and responsiblities as a renter. You can pick one up at the ASNMSU office (second floor of Corbett). You should also read up about <a href="http://www.rentersinsurance.net/new-mexico.html">renter's insurance</a>. Where have people lived? Here's a quick summary:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<a href="http://www.casabandera.com/">Casa Bandera</a> - across the street from NMSU, swimming pool, small workout room, laundry in apartment, refrigerated air ... some haven't liked the undergraduate feel to it but others are perfectly fine with it<br />
the Grove - a block from NMSU, swimming pool ... some haven't liked the undergraduate feel to it but others are perfectly fine with it<br />
Las Palmas - across the street from NMSU, smaller but quiet, refrigerated air, laundry on site, allows small pets<br />
<a href="http://www.mathersrealty.net/">Mathers Realty</a> owns many properties in Las Cruces, and one of them is across the street from NMSU at 1201 E. University Ave, evaporative cooling<br />
Villa Sierra Apartments - large apartment complex on Treviz (down the street from NMSU), refrigerated air, swimming pool, small workout room<br />
<a href="http://www.sunridgevillageapartments-lascrucesnm.com/">SunRidge Village</a> - large apartment complex on Treviz (down the street from NMSU), swimming pool<br />
Tuscany Villa - large apartment complex on Roadrunner (some distance from NMSU), swimming pool<br />
Copperstone - large gated apartment complex on Roadrunner (some distance from NMSU), refrigerated air, laundry in apartment, swimming pool, allows pets<br />
Willow Brook Apartment Homes - large apartment complex past Rt. 70 (some distance from NMSU)

<a name="driving"></a><h3>Driving in New Mexico</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Thankfully, you can look online for the <a href="http://www.mvd.newmexico.gov/index.html">New Mexico Motor Vehicle Division</a> forms to get your driver's license. You may apply for a 4 or 8 year license. If you are under 25 years old and getting an NM license for the first time, you have to go through a <a href="http://dce.unm.edu/dwi-education.htm">drunk driving awareness program</a> to get your license <strong>even if you hold a license in another state</strong>. The process takes about two weeks (plus any additional weeks due to inherent bureaucratic silliness).</p>
You may have noticed that the astro department has two cars of its own. <a href="nmnmsu.html#driving">What's up with that?</a>
</div>
<a name="residency"></a>
<h3>NM State Residency</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
<p>Several of our students have had issues about whether they need to pay in-state tuition. This is especially relevant for students who are on "external" fellowships, e.g. from NSF or NASA. To avoid any issues, it is critical that everyone apply for and establish NM residency as soon as you are eligible (after you have been in New Mexico for one year). Not sure if you're considered a resident? When you check your student account on <a href="https://my.nmsu.edu/">myNMSU</a>,  it should either say LC TUITION GR RESD PT (you're considered a resident) or LC TUITION GR NRES PT (you're considered a non-resident NRES).</p>
<p>NMSU has a webpage with <a href="http://nmsu.edu/~registra/residency.html">information about in-state residency</a> and there is also a <a href="http://hed.state.nm.us/uploads/files/Residency.pdf">brochure from the NM Higher Education Department</a>. Applications must be submitted to the NMSU Registrar by the beginning of the semester (which they define as 21 calendar days before the first day of classes). Actually, we recommend you file as soon as possible during the Summer to avoid long lines at the Registrar's Office.
</p>
You will need to fill out <a href="http://www.hed.state.nm.us/uploads/files/Petition%20For%20In-State%20Tuition%20Classification%20Final.pdf">this form</a> as well as provide any two of the following documents:
<div style="margin-left: 10px;">
<li>NM driver's license</li>
<li>a copy of your lease or leases that covers at least 1 full year of living in NM, (or home ownership documents if you don't rent)</li>
<li>pay stub from NMSU</li>
<li>NM car registration</li>
<li>NM voter registration</li>
<li>NM tax return from the previous year</li>
<li>NM bank statement</li>
<li>utility bills showing your name and your NM address</li>
<li>proof that you aren't a dependent of you parents (<strong>if you're under 23 years of age</strong>, you must present a copy of your  parents'  1040 or 1040A  income tax form)</li>
</div>
<p>To keep track of this and to make sure we avoid problems, we are asking that when you receive notification that residency has been established, that you give a copy of this to Ofelia to keep in your file. If you already have this, giving them a copy would be great.</p>
</div>
<a name="taxes"></a><h3>Filing State Taxes</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">
You can <a href="https://ec3.state.nm.us/nmwebfile/">file online</a> or <a href="http://www.tax.newmexico.gov/Forms-and-Publications/Pages/Home.aspx">download the forms</a> and mail them to Sante Fe. Don't forget about your federal taxes! Some students have used <a href="http://turbotax.intuit.com/">TurboTax</a> to file online for free. </div>

<a name="vote"></a><h3>Registering to Vote</h3>
<div style="margin-left:20px;">

Register to vote in New Mexico by filling out the Voter Registration Form and returning it to the ASNMSU office (Corbett Student Center) or they can deliver them directly to the Dona Ana County Bureau of Elections (845 N.
